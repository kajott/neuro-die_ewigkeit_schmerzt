2022 update and new windows port by KeyJ / TRBL

this demo is coded entirely in python, and the entire source
code is included. it features a quite complete svg loader,
and ctypes-based abstractions for sdl and glsl.

the first time running it will take some time because
it needs to render polygons and outlines from the shapes
first. all data is cached, so the second time you run it
it will load quite fast.

new features in the 2022 update:
- Python 2.7 and 64-bit compatibility
- support for wider aspect ratios
- spatio-temporal antialiasing, similar to Masagin's
- working parameter parser
- demo auto-quits itself when it's done
- hidden mouse cursor

enjoy.
