Die Ewigkeit schmerzt

code
paniq

additional gfx
tournesol

this demo is coded entirely in python, and the entire source
code is included. it features a quite complete svg loader,
and ctypes-based abstractions for sdl and glsl.

the first time running it will take some time because
it needs to render polygons and outlines from the shapes
first. all data is cached, so the second time you run it
it will load quite fast.

gpl licence.

enjoy.
